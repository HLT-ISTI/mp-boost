MP-Boost++ is a C++ implementation of AdaBoost.MH and MPBoost, a multi-label-specific variant of AdaBoost that is more accurate and requires less iterations.

###Compiling MP-Boost++

~~~~
~/mp-boost/> tar zxvf mpboost_latest_source.tar.gz
~/mp-boost/> make
~~~~

That should be enough, provided that you have make and g++ (currently using version 4.3.3).
Binaries are created directly into the mpboost directory.

###Input format

MPBoost and AdaBoost.MH use binary features, so no weight information is provided for the features.
MPBoost and AdaBoost.MH are multi-label classification algorithms, i.e., a document could belong to zero, one, or more than one category.

The input format for MP-Boost++ is based on a sparse vector representation, using text files and describing one vector per line.
The format of a line describing a vector is:

~~~~
<ID> <featureID>* | <categoryID>*
~~~~

with feature IDs and category IDs sorted in ascending order. The

For example, the line describing document with ID 3, containing features 3, 6, 103, and 201, and belonging to categories 3 and 9 is:

~~~~
3 3 6 103 201 | 3 9
~~~~

The pipe character is used to define where the feature list ends and category list starts. If a document has no category, the pipe at the end of the line can be omitted.

###Train and Test

In order to perform a train and test experiment, MPBoost++ must be provided with a training data file and one (or more) test data file.
The boostTrain program is used to learn a classification model out of the training data file.
The boostTest program is used to classify test data using the learned classification model.
The showEvaluation program is used to show the evaluation of the classification results, in the form of contingency tables and effectiveness measures. The output of showEvaluation is optimized for direct copy & paste into a spreadsheet.
In the case multiple test data files are used (e.g., for RCV1 v2) the mergeEvaluation program can be used to merge the partial evaluation on each test data file into a single evaluation.
